# comika
A little project I made to view comic book sales data. It helped me get familiar with MongoDB, Python, and Google Charts API.

### Features
- Cool logo.
- Python script that imports comic book sales data into MongoDB via CSV file.
- Ability to search (w/ pagination).
- Dynamic charts using Google Charts API.
- Some fancy customization for sales calculation in chart tooltip.
